      <h1>Family.</h1>
      <p>
        Consists of a mom, a dad, a sister, and two dogs.
        I have a mother who owns a deli in the North Loop (previously known as the Warehouse District before it got super hip/cool)
        in Mpls. She is a bad ass, and where I get my enterpurneural spirit from. As well as my fearlessness in trying new things.
        My father is a career Software Developer who also is a co-owner of C. McGees (...because family business. so you wear all the hats)
        He is a bad ass as well. Most of what I learned from him can be summed up in one liners.
        Taught me things more along the lines of there are more important things in life than school/grades, winning is more fun than losing,
        if you're not cheating, you're not trying hard enough, and ...
        My sister is my best friend in the entire world and would be my life partner if that didn't involve romantic relations. She is a
        control freak in the best way and the person you want on your side when sh*t goes down (seriously... don't get on her bad side), she has
        the will power of a (insert whatever has a ton of will power), is HA-LARIOUS, and is the most loyal person I know. She is also very responsible.
        We've done most of the important things in life together. Living in crappy apartments throughout college, bought a house, acquired a
        dog. And pretty much everything else along the way.
        Jamie and I's dog.
        My Parent's dog.

      <h1>Work.</h1>
      <p>
        I work at General Mills as a Software Developer (So like you work in a Cheerios factory?/General Mills has technologies?)
        Yes... and they also have people within IT that are some of the smartest, collaborative people I've met. I'm sure I'll plug
        all the cool things we get to do at work in another blog post so I'll leave it at that.
        <i>Yes</i>, General Mills has a thriving IT department. Does interesting things.
        I <i>do</i> get a lot of free food at work.
      </p>

      <h1>Hobbies.</h1>
      <p>
        <p>
          My boyfriend, Jesse, is probably my hobby that takes up most of my time. We do some of my other hobbies together (usually of the
          eating and exploring mn variety). We met in August 2015 at a bar (guess that still happens), and the rest is history. He has a
          dog Ralphie that I love very much, and lives in South St. Paul, which is very far away, and is from Crandon, WI (even farther away),
          where his parents still live (who I also love very much... His mother is the (something something?) and does an amazing job.
          Definitely should visit). He plays football and coaches for the Minnesota Sting (depending on his current injury situation),
          watches documentaries religiously, and has a questionable (in my opinion) belief in the supernatural (think Everyday Aliens).
